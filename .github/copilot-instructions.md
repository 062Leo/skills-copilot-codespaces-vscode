# GitHub Copilot Instructions

This repository is a GitHub Skills training course for learning GitHub Copilot. It contains educational materials and example code to help users understand how to use GitHub Copilot effectively.

## General Guidelines

- This is a learning repository, so code should be simple and easy to understand
- Prioritize clarity and educational value over advanced optimizations
- Include helpful comments when they add educational value
- Keep examples minimal and focused on demonstrating Copilot features

## JavaScript Guidelines

- Use simple, clear JavaScript functions
- Include descriptive function names that help Copilot understand intent
- Use console.log for output in examples
- Follow standard JavaScript naming conventions (camelCase for functions and variables)
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose

## Android/Kotlin Guidelines

For the `android-game` directory:

- Use Kotlin for all Android code
- Follow Jetpack Compose best practices for UI components
- Use meaningful state variable names
- Keep the game logic simple and easy to follow
- Follow Android SDK conventions and Material Design guidelines
- Use `remember` and `mutableStateOf` for state management in Compose
- Document game states clearly

## Code Style

- Use consistent indentation (spaces preferred)
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable and function names
- Keep functions short and focused
- Avoid overly complex patterns since this is educational content

## Dependencies

- Minimize external dependencies
- For JavaScript: use vanilla JavaScript when possible
- For Android: rely on Android SDK and Jetpack Compose standard libraries
- Only add new dependencies if absolutely necessary for the learning objectives

## Documentation

- Update README.md files when adding new features or examples
- Keep documentation beginner-friendly
- Include code examples in documentation where helpful
- Explain "why" not just "what" in educational contexts
